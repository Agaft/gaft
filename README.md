# gaftHello,

Your interest in this program is very pleasant for me. I hope it will be useful for you.
Here is program of language self-studying. I made it for me as bilingual "Ukrainian - German" In addition you have a possibility to enter English variant of the word.  Everybody can use this program for any other three languages, because all information you enter by yourself. Only language flags remain the same. 

You can enter the word in "Vocabulary" Menu. German words entered taking into account definite peculiarities of verbs and substantives. It is not necessary to fill all fields. Only those you need. In the right window you can enter all useful for you notes associated with the word - phrases, synonymous commentaries etc.
 
The words and notes you have entered must be saved separately to the corresponding virtual data bases. At the end of each session virtual data based must be saved to the corresponding files. Appropriate buttons activated when it is necessary.

In the "Handbook" Menu there is reference information which is necessary at initial studies of learning German language.

In the "Test" Menu there are two tests. One test for knowledge of words and the second - for knowledge of noun gender. You can exclude the words you have study  from tests with the help of button "Ich kenne dieses Wort". At the end of the session all these words must be saved in corresponding file. Then you can pass through tests with or without these words.

All questions connected with using the program, please send by E-mail: agaftenko@gmail.com

I wish you a success in studying!
